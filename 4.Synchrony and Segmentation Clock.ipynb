    "d) We are now prepared to model the spatio-temporal production of zebrafish somites via travelling waves. To do so, consider the 100 oscillators not as randomly positioned in space, but rather along the anterior-posterior axis of a growing tail. Modify your simulation from earlier as follows:\n",
    "1) Instead of being globally coupled, each oscillator is now coupled to its two neighbors: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\theta_i} = \\omega_i + \\alpha\\sin(\\theta_{i+1}−\\theta_i)+\\alpha\\sin(\\theta_{i−1}−\\theta_i)$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\omega_i = 1 − e^{−i/\\lambda}$, and set $\\lambda = 20$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Add a new oscillator with phase equal to the last to the end of the vector about 10 times per oscillation (does not have to be exact). When you do this, shift the ω gradient over by one to include the new oscillator, and stop simulating the anterior- most oscillators. Alternatively, this can be thought of as having a 100-oscillator ’active’ simulation region with new oscillators being added at the posterior end which causes old oscillators to be pushed out of the ’active’ region at the anterior end (i.e. frozen). The new oscillator phase can be set to the same phase as the previously posterior-most oscillator. Choose reasonable parameters as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the sine of the oscillators over space (not over time as was done earlier) for several time values to show the travelling waves and “freezing” of the anterior “segments.” It may help to animate your simulation by re-plotting sinθ every time step. The commands drawnow and pause may come in handy if you choose to do this. Include in your submission a few (eg. 5 – 10) such plots at various time points during the progress of your simulation. 15 pts."
